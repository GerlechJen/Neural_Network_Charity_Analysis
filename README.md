# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview


A non-profit philanthropic foundation Alphabet Soup dedicated to helping organizations that protect the environment, improve peoples well being, and unify the world 
The foundation has raised and donated over 10 billion dollars in the past 20 years. The money has been used to invest in life saving technologies and organize reforge station groups around the world.
As part of my job, I analyse the impact of each donation and vet potential recipients which helps to ensure donations is being used effectively. 
Unfortunately, from the analysis, not all donations the company makes is impactful. Sometimes an organization takes the money and disappears.
I have been asked to design a model that will accurately predict which organizations are worth donating to and which are too high risk. I will create a mathematical data driven solution which will do this accurately.
I will design and train a deep learning neural network that will evaluate all types of input data and produce a clear decision-making result using the python TensorFlow library.
To help test and optimize the model, I will be using my knowledge on statistics and machine learning. This robust deep learning network capable of interpreting large data sets, will help Alphabet Soup Determine which organizations should receive donations.
